# Peer review findings for "The Five-Layer Paradigm"

The manuscript's core claim — that ~758 physical cat qubits can encode 100 logical qubits at κ₁/κ₂ = 10⁻⁴ — originates entirely from Ruiz et al. (Nature Communications 2025) and is accurately cited, though the **65× gap between current hardware (κ₁/κ₂ ≈ 6.5 × 10⁻³) and the required 10⁻⁴ is a serious feasibility concern** the manuscript underplays. The five-layer integration concept is novel as a unified proposal, but its novelty is incremental: layers 1–3 were already published by Ruiz et al. (2025), and layers 4–5 (cryo-CMOS and phononic shielding) are imported from independent research on transmons and spin qubits with no demonstrated compatibility with cat qubit platforms. The comparison table contains one significant overestimate (IBM bivariate bicycle codes), and several key recent references are missing. Below is a detailed analysis of every claim.

## Verification of experimental claims and references

**AWS Ocelot chip (Putterman et al., Nature 638, 927–934, Feb 2025).** The manuscript's characterization is broadly accurate. The chip uses **5 cat data qubits, 5 buffer circuits, and 4 transmon ancillas** (9 total "qubit" components). It demonstrated below-threshold operation for the phase-flip repetition code at distances d = 3 and d = 5, with logical error rates of **1.75(2)% (d = 3) and 1.65(3)% (d = 5)** per cycle. Bit-flip times approach **1 second**, while phase-flip times are approximately **20 µs in the multi-qubit context** (a companion single-cat paper, Putterman et al., Phys. Rev. X 15, 011070, March 2025, reports T₁,eff ≈ 70 µs on a standalone device). If the manuscript cites specific phase-flip times, it should distinguish between the standalone and integrated values.

**Alice & Bob Boson 4 (7-minute bit-flip times).** The ~430-second (~7 min) bit-flip time is confirmed by Alice & Bob's corporate communications and December 2024 white paper. However, an important caveat: **no peer-reviewed publication or preprint exists for Boson 4**. The product page explicitly states "[Preprint coming soon]." The peer-reviewed Nature paper (Réglade et al., Nature 629, 778–783, 2024) reports results for the **Boson 3 chip** (bit-flip times >10 seconds with quantum control). The manuscript should acknowledge this distinction.

**Alice & Bob Galvanic Cat (September 2025).** The 33–60 minute bit-flip time claim is accurate, matching the **95% Bayesian confidence interval** from Alice & Bob's September 25, 2025 blog post. The point estimate is ~44 minutes. However, these are **preliminary, unpublished results** shared via press release only. Key caveats the manuscript should note: (1) the impact of the Z gate drive on bit-flip incidence was not measured in this experiment, and (2) the 2030 roadmap target of 13-minute bit-flip times must hold **during two-qubit CNOT gates**, which has not been demonstrated at these timescales.

**Ruiz et al. LDPC-cat code (Nature Communications 16, 1040, Jan 26, 2025).** Confirmed. The paper states that "one hundred logical qubits can be implemented on a 758 cat qubit chip, with a total logical error probability per cycle and per logical qubit ε_L ≤ 10⁻⁸." The code family uses **classical LDPC codes** (not quantum LDPC) with cellular automaton structure [165+8ℓ, 34+2ℓ, 22], weight-≤9 stabilizers, and 2D local connectivity. The critical assumption is **κ₁/κ₂ = 10⁻⁴**, which remains aspirational. Authors include Alice & Bob and Inria affiliates with declared financial interests.

**Qing et al. / Siddiqi group operational bias (PNAS 123(5), Feb 3, 2026).** The ~250 bias figure is confirmed but requires nuance. The paper reports operational noise bias "approaching 250" for the **detuned Kerr-cat qubit** specifically (not the standard resonant Kerr-cat), measured via dihedral group randomized benchmarking (DRB). Critically, the paper warns of **"critical overestimation of operational noise bias inferred from bit-flip and phase-flip times alone"** — naive T_bitflip/T_phaseflip ratios give much higher values (~1000). The manuscript should note that this ~250 figure reflects rigorous gate-level benchmarking, not idle noise ratios.

**Chen & Painter (Science Advances 10, eado6240, Sept 2024).** Confirmed. Demonstrated a **1.372 GHz-wide acoustic bandgap centered at ~5.128 GHz** using cross-shield phononic crystals on silicon-on-insulator. TLS relaxation times within the bandgap increased by **100× (T₁ > 5 ms)**. This is AWS/Caltech work by Painter's group.

**Odeh & Sipahigil (Nature Physics 21, 406–411, Jan 2025).** Confirmed. Demonstrated non-Markovian qubit dynamics on a phononic bandgap metamaterial with **TLS lifetime extended to 34 µs** via Purcell engineering. Complementary to Chen & Painter but from UC Berkeley, with emphasis on qubit dynamics rather than TLS spectroscopy.

**Zhou et al. interface piezoelectricity (Nature Communications 17, 377, 2026).** This paper **is published** — it appeared online December 5, 2025 (volume 17, formally 2026). It reports the first observation of interface piezoelectricity at aluminum-silicon junctions, with effective electromechanical coupling K² ≈ (3 ± 0.4) × 10⁻⁵%, limiting qubit quality factors to **Q ~ 10⁴–10⁸**. This provides direct motivation for phononic bandgap engineering.

**Benhayoune-Khadraoui et al. (arXiv 2507.06160, July 2025).** Confirmed preprint (not journal-published). Identifies that the Kerr-cat qubit fails above a critical drive amplitude due to **multimode circuit effects** — the buffer mode and higher Josephson junction array modes induce multiphoton resonances. Uses Floquet-Markov framework. Proposes that electromagnetic environment engineering can "rescue" the Kerr-cat. This is relevant to the manuscript's phononic shielding layer.

**Martinez et al. chaos-assisted tunneling (arXiv 2510.15175, Oct 2025).** Confirmed preprint. Claims that **chaos-assisted tunneling imposes an intrinsic, fundamental limit** to Kerr-cat qubit protection — even within single-mode dynamics, chaotic states mediate tunneling between cat states when nonlinearities are strong. This is potentially more fundamental than the Benhayoune-Khadraoui multimode effects and raises questions about whether phononic engineering alone can address all failure modes.

**Hann et al. hybrid cat-transmon (PRX Quantum 6, 030305, July 11, 2025).** Confirmed. This is AWS's theoretical scaling paper proposing a thin rectangular **surface code** (not LDPC) with cat-transmon entangling gates (CRX gate). Predicts physical error rates ~10⁻³ with noise biases of 10³–10⁴ simultaneously, achieving overhead equivalent to unbiased architectures with 10⁻⁵–10⁻⁴ physical error rates. Notably, this paper's gate fidelities scale with **κ₁/χ** (dispersive coupling), not κ₁/κ₂, removing the need for very strong engineered dissipation.

**Intel Pando Tree (VLSI 2024).** Confirmed. First mK cryogenic CMOS demultiplexer by a semiconductor manufacturer, operating at **10–20 mK**, controlling **up to 64 qubit terminals** using **22nm low-power FinFET** technology. Works in tandem with Horse Ridge II at 4K.

**Bartee et al. mK CMOS (Nature 643, 382–387, June 2025).** Confirmed. First benchmarking of spin qubits controlled by heterogeneously integrated cryo-CMOS at mK temperatures, with **~10 µW total power** and **>100,000 transistors**. Demonstrated negligible impact on single- and two-qubit gate fidelities. Note: this was designed for **silicon spin qubits**, not superconducting qubits.

**Bluvstein et al. 96 logical qubits.** Confirmed in Nature 649, 39–46 (published online November 10, 2025, print January 2026). Uses **448 neutral atoms** with [[16,6,4]] high-rate codes to demonstrate **96 distance-4 logical qubits simultaneously**. The manuscript's citation as "Nature 2025" is acceptable given the online publication date.

**Quantinuum Helios 48 logical qubits.** Confirmed. Launched November 5, 2025, with **98 physical barium ion qubits** encoding **48 error-corrected logical qubits** at a remarkable 2:1 ratio. Uses concatenated symplectic double cover (genon) codes with [[4,2,2]] Iceberg codes. Note: the base codes are only distance-2, so single-error correction relies on the concatenation layer.

**IBM bivariate bicycle / Tour de Gross.** The original gross code paper (Bravyi et al., Nature 627, March 2024) introduced the [[144, 12, 12]] code. "Tour de Gross" (arXiv:2506.03094, June 2025) is an **arXiv preprint** by Yoder et al. proposing full fault-tolerant computation with gross codes.

## The comparison table has one significant error

The surface code estimate of **100,000–1,000,000 physical qubits for 100 logical qubits is broadly reasonable**, though the lower end is more likely for most applications. At standard physical error rates of 10⁻³, surface codes require ~500 physical qubits per logical qubit for memory alone (Yoked surface codes, Nature Communications 2025). For algorithmically relevant error rates requiring d = 15–30, including lattice surgery routing and magic state distillation, **100,000–400,000 total physical qubits** is the consensus range for 100 logical qubits. The upper bound of 1 million applies mainly to cryptographically demanding workloads.

The IBM bivariate bicycle estimate of **10,000–20,000 is likely an overestimate**. IBM's own projections suggest "a few thousand" physical qubits for ~100 logical qubits. The gross code achieves a [[144, 12, 12]] encoding — roughly **24 physical qubits per logical qubit** (including syndrome qubits). Nine gross code modules (288 × 9 = 2,592 physical qubits) encode 108 logical qubits. Even with logical processing units and magic state factories, IBM's Starling processor (targeting 2029) envisions "200 logical qubits" from "thousands of physical qubits." The manuscript's 10,000–20,000 figure overstates IBM's overhead by roughly **3–5×** and should be corrected or justified.

The neutral atom (Bluvstein) and trapped ion (Quantinuum Helios) figures are accurate. However, the Quantinuum 2:1 encoding rate should be contextualized — it uses distance-2 base codes with concatenation, which provides different error correction guarantees than higher-distance codes.

## The κ₁/κ₂ gap is plausible but imprecisely sourced

The claim that the current best κ₁/κ₂ is **6.5 × 10⁻³** is plausible based on Ocelot's operational parameters (T₁,eff ≈ 70 µs implies κ₁ ≈ 14 kHz; if κ₂ ≈ 350–500 kHz, the ratio is in the low 10⁻³ range). However, this specific value does not appear verbatim in the public text of the Putterman Nature paper — it may be derived from supplementary materials or parameter fitting. The Alice & Bob AutoCat design (Marquet et al., PRX 2024) achieved κ₂/2π ≈ 2 MHz, which with typical κ₁ values would give κ₁/κ₂ ~ 10⁻³. **The 65× improvement to reach 10⁻⁴ is arithmetically correct but the starting point should be more precisely sourced.** The reviewer should request the authors specify exactly which experimental result yields 6.5 × 10⁻³ and from which supplementary data.

An additional concern: the Hann et al. (PRX Quantum 2025) paper shows that the hybrid cat-transmon architecture's gate fidelities scale with **κ₁/χ rather than κ₁/κ₂**, meaning the κ₁/κ₂ figure of merit may not be the most relevant parameter for all proposed architectures. The manuscript should address why it focuses on κ₁/κ₂ rather than κ₁/χ as the critical ratio.

## Novelty is incremental, not transformative

**No published paper proposes the identical five-layer integration.** However, the novelty is significantly diminished by existing work:

The most critical overlap is with **Ruiz et al. (Nature Communications 2025)**, which already proposes the combination of cat qubits (layer 1) + bosonic encoding (layer 2) + classical LDPC codes (layer 3) and provides the 758-qubit figure the manuscript builds upon. This covers three of five layers. The manuscript's layers 4 (cryo-CMOS) and 5 (phononic shielding) are imported from independent research communities (spin qubits and transmons respectively) with **no demonstrated compatibility with cat qubit platforms**. No paper has shown cryo-CMOS control of cat qubits, and phononic bandgap engineering has been applied only to transmon qubits, not to the buffer/storage mode structures required for dissipative cat qubits.

AWS's own roadmap paper (Hann et al., PRX Quantum 2025) proposes a different scaling path — thin rectangular surface codes with cat-transmon gates — rather than the LDPC approach. Alice & Bob's December 2024 roadmap outlines a five-milestone path (Boson → Helium → Lithium → Beryllium → Graphene) explicitly including LDPC codes but using their own proprietary qubit designs, not the architecture proposed here. The manuscript should clearly position itself relative to both roadmaps.

**The manuscript's main contribution is thus an integration-level synthesis** — arguing that combining all five layers yields synergies greater than the sum of parts. For this to be compelling, the manuscript needs quantitative analysis of how layers 4 and 5 specifically improve the LDPC-cat code performance metrics (e.g., how phononic shielding changes the achievable κ₁/κ₂, and how cryo-CMOS changes the classical processing latency budget). Without such analysis, the five-layer proposal remains speculative.

## At least 15 important references appear to be missing

The manuscript should cite the following, organized by category:

**Foundational cat qubit theory** that provides essential context: Guillaud & Mirrahimi, "Repetition Cat Qubits for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation" (Phys. Rev. X 9, 041053, 2019); Puri et al., "Bias-preserving gates with stabilized cat qubits" (Science Advances 6, 2020); and Mirrahimi et al., "Dynamically protected cat-qubits" (New J. Phys. 16, 2014). These are the theoretical foundations underlying everything the manuscript proposes.

**Critical competing architectures**: Chamberland et al., "Building a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer Using Concatenated Cat Codes" (PRX Quantum 3, 2022), which is AWS's earlier full fault-tolerant architecture paper with resource estimates; and Gouzien et al., "Performance analysis of a repetition cat code architecture" (PRL 131, 2023), which provides algorithmic resource estimates for repetition-cat codes.

**Recent experimental milestones**: Rousseau, Ruiz, Albertinale et al., "Enhancing dissipative cat qubit protection by squeezing" (arXiv:2502.07892, Feb 2025), which demonstrates **160× improvement in bit-flip time** using squeezed cat qubits — a potentially important alternative path to improving cat qubit performance.

**Bias-tailored LDPC codes**: Roffe, White, Burton, Campbell, "Bias-tailored quantum LDPC codes" (Quantum 7, 1005, 2023), which introduces the bias-tailored lifted product construction directly relevant to designing LDPC codes for cat qubits; and Wu et al., "Bias-tailored single-shot quantum LDPC codes" (arXiv:2507.02239, 2025).

**Cryo-CMOS**: van Staveren et al. (IEEE Trans. Quantum Eng. 2025) on mK cryo-CMOS DAC+demux controlling 648 quantum devices at <70 mK; and Brennan et al., "Classical interfaces for controlling cryogenic quantum computing technologies" (APL Quantum 2(4), Dec 2025), a comprehensive review of the field.

**Alice & Bob's Elevator Codes** (announced January 2026): A new concatenation technique claiming 10,000× lower logical error rate with ~3× more qubits, which may alter the LDPC-cat code overhead calculations the manuscript relies upon.

## Summary of key concerns for the peer review

The manuscript accurately represents most individual references, with the IBM bivariate bicycle overhead being the one clear overestimate. The 758-qubit claim is properly attributed to Ruiz et al. but the manuscript must be transparent that this assumes a **65× improvement** in κ₁/κ₂ beyond current hardware, making the headline figure aspirational rather than near-term. The Boson 4 and Galvanic Cat results lack peer-reviewed publications. The novelty is primarily integrative rather than conceptual — layers 1–3 are published prior work, and layers 4–5 have not been demonstrated with cat qubits. The most significant gap is the absence of quantitative modeling showing how the cryo-CMOS and phononic layers specifically improve fault-tolerance thresholds or resource counts beyond what Ruiz et al. already projected. The chaos-assisted tunneling result (Martinez et al.) and multimode failure modes (Benhayoune-Khadraoui et al.) deserve serious discussion as potential fundamental limits that phononic engineering alone may not address.
