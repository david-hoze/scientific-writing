# Peer review of "The Five-Layer Paradigm" manuscript: claim verification and gap analysis

**The manuscript's core bibliographic claims are largely accurate, but it contains two significant factual errors and omits several important competing approaches.** Verification of the ten specific citation clusters reveals that most references check out in their journal, volume, and year details. However, the Ocelot phase-flip time is misattributed by a factor of ~30–40×, and the one-hour bit-flip result is incorrectly attributed to the Boson 4 chip. Beyond these errors, the manuscript underrepresents the competitive landscape — particularly GKP-based concatenation architectures, neutral-atom qLDPC implementations, and alternative classical control paradigms such as SFQ logic and photonic links. This report details every finding, organized by verification task and then gap analysis.

## Two critical factual errors require correction

**Error 1: Ocelot phase-flip time.** The manuscript states a phase-flip time of ~420–500 ns for the AWS Ocelot chip (Putterman et al., _Nature_ 638, 927–934, 2025). This is incorrect. The Ocelot chip's effective storage lifetime under two-photon dissipation is **T₁,eff ≈ 57–68 μs**, yielding phase-flip times of approximately **14–17 μs** at mean photon number |α|² = 4. The ~490 ns figure appears in Réglade et al. (_Nature_ 629, 778–783, 2024) from Alice & Bob's Boson 3 chip, not in the Ocelot paper. The manuscript has evidently conflated two different experiments, producing an error of roughly 30–40×. This must be corrected, as it materially affects any resource estimate that depends on phase-flip rates.

**Error 2: Boson 4 attribution of one-hour bit-flip result.** The manuscript attributes the 33–60 minute bit-flip time to "preliminary Boson 4 chip results." In fact, Alice & Bob's September 25, 2025 press release explicitly states this result was achieved on a **Galvanic Cat design** — the same architecture used on their Helium 2 multi-qubit chip — not on Boson 4. Boson 4's record stands at approximately **7 minutes (~430 seconds)**, set in 2024. Additionally, the one-hour result comes from an unpublished company press release labeled "preliminary results," not from a peer-reviewed publication or preprint. The manuscript should correct the chip attribution and flag the preliminary, non-peer-reviewed status of this claim. A footnote in the Alice & Bob announcement also notes that the impact of the Z-gate drive on bit-flip incidence was not measured, and that the 2030 target requires maintaining bit-flip suppression during two-qubit CNOT gates — a significantly more stringent requirement.

A minor citation error also exists: arXiv:2512.24926 (bosonic module interconnects) lists **Hongwei Huang** as first author, not Wang. Weiting Wang is the fourth author. The citation should read Huang et al. (2025).

## Claims that verify correctly

The remaining citations check out with high fidelity against the published literature:

**Réglade et al. (_Nature_ 629, 778–783, 2024)** confirms bit-flip lifetimes exceeding **10 seconds** at mean photon number |α|² ≈ 11.3, achieved on Alice & Bob's Boson 3 chip using a TomCat design with an asymmetrically threaded SQUID on sapphire substrate with sputtered tantalum. Phase-flip times exceeded 490 ns. The citation details (journal, volume, year) are exact.

**Putterman et al. (_Nature_ 638, 927–934, 2025)** confirms the Ocelot chip with five cat data qubits, four ancilla transmons, and distance-5 repetition code operating **below threshold** for phase-flip correction. Logical error rates per cycle were **1.72% for d = 3** and **1.65% for d = 5**, demonstrating that increasing code distance improves performance. The manuscript's characterization of "below-threshold concatenated bosonic error correction" is accurate.

**Ruiz et al. (_Nature Communications_ 16, 1040, 2025)** confirms all three numerical claims: **100 logical qubits** encodable in **758 physical cat qubits** with logical error rates **≤ 10⁻⁸** per cycle per logical qubit. The paper assumes physical phase-flip error probability ε ≈ 0.1% and κ₁/κ₂ = 10⁻⁴ (the current experimental value is 6.5 × 10⁻³, roughly 65× worse). The manuscript should note these assumptions explicitly, as the claimed qubit counts depend critically on achieving hardware parameters not yet demonstrated.

**Qing et al. (_PNAS_ 123(5), e2520479123, 2026; arXiv:2411.04442)** confirms an operational noise bias of **~250** measured via dihedral randomized benchmarking on a detuned Kerr-cat qubit from Siddiqi's group at UC Berkeley. The PNAS publication (received August 2025, accepted December 2025, published January 2026) and the arXiv ID both verify. One important nuance the manuscript should convey: the paper explicitly warns that **idle bias measurements dramatically overestimate operational bias**. The idle bias inferred from bit-flip/phase-flip times alone exceeds 50,000 (per companion paper Hajr et al., _Phys. Rev. X_ 14, 041049, 2024), while the operational bias during gates is only ~250 — a **200× discrepancy** that has direct implications for error correction overhead calculations.

All three **cryo-CMOS citations** verify: Intel Pando Tree was presented at IEEE VLSI 2024 as a millikelvin cryo-CMOS demultiplexer in 22nm FinFET; IMEC's multiplexer appears in _Nature Electronics_ 6, 900–909 (2023) operating below 15 mK with 0.6 μW static power; and IBM's cross-resonance gate paper appears in _PRX Quantum_ 5, 010326 (2024) with a cryo-CMOS ASIC at 4 K demonstrating the first two-qubit randomized benchmarking via cryogenic electronics.

Both **phononic bandgap citations** verify: Chen & Painter (_Science Advances_ 10, eado6240, 2024) demonstrated a **100× increase in TLS relaxation time** (T₁ > 5 ms) using acoustic bandgap engineering; Odeh & Sipahigil (_Nature Physics_ 21, 406–411, 2025) observed non-Markovian qubit dynamics inside a phononic bandgap with Purcell-engineered TLS lifetime of **34 μs**.

**IBM Tour de Gross** (arXiv:2506.03094, June 2025) verifies as a modular fault-tolerant architecture using bivariate bicycle codes, with explicit compilation strategies and resource estimates showing an order-of-magnitude advantage over surface codes. **Huang et al.** (arXiv:2512.24926, December 2025) verifies as demonstrating a bosonic module interconnect with **98.2% state transfer fidelity** and **92.5% Bell state fidelity** using SNAIL-based couplers.

## Competing architectures the manuscript should acknowledge

The manuscript's competitive landscape discussion appears incomplete. Several major developments from 2024–2025 warrant explicit comparison:

**GKP-based concatenation architectures** represent the most direct alternative to cat-qubit concatenation. Borah et al. (arXiv:2505.06385, May 2025) investigate QLDPC codes concatenated with GKP inner codes under circuit-level noise, showing that real-time analog soft information from GKP syndrome measurements significantly boosts decoder performance — a capability cat qubits lack. The Tesseract code (arXiv:2409.05813, September 2024) proposes a multimode GKP encoding in two bosonic modes with explicit superconducting architecture, directly competing with the five-layer approach. Brock et al. (_Nature_ 641, 612–618, 2025) from Yale demonstrated GKP qudit error correction beyond break-even, extending the bosonic code paradigm to qudits. The manuscript should explain why cat qubits are preferred over GKP despite GKP's symmetric noise correction and analog information advantages.

**Neutral-atom qLDPC implementations** have progressed rapidly. Bluvstein et al. (_Nature_, 2025) demonstrated universal fault-tolerant processing with up to **448 neutral atoms** and **96 logical qubits** — nearly matching the manuscript's 100-logical-qubit target, albeit at higher physical qubit count. QuEra achieved a **3,000-qubit array** operating continuously for over 2 hours (published in _Nature_, September 2025) and demonstrated transversal algorithmic fault tolerance reducing QEC runtime cost by 10–100×. Neutral atoms' reconfigurable connectivity makes qLDPC implementation natural without the 2D locality constraints that cat-qubit architectures must navigate.

**Quantinuum's trapped-ion qLDPC work** includes the first-ever implementation of a nonlocal qLDPC code on real hardware — a [[25, 4, 3]] code on the H2 processor encoding 4 logical qubits in 25 physical qubits with fidelity exceeding break-even (arXiv:2406.02666, June 2024). Their Helios system (November 2025) operates **98 barium ion qubits** with two-qubit gate fidelity of **99.921%**. The all-to-all connectivity of trapped ions makes qLDPC codes substantially easier to implement than on superconducting platforms.

**Google's Willow chip** (_Nature_ 638, 920–926, December 2024) achieved the first below-threshold surface code memory on superconducting qubits with error suppression factor Λ = 2.14 from d = 5 to d = 7. Their resource estimates — ~1,457 physical qubits for one logical qubit at 10⁻⁶ error rate — provide the baseline overhead that the cat-qubit approach claims to dramatically reduce. Google's **Yoked Surface Codes** (_Nature Communications_, 2025) reduce surface code overhead to as few as **one-third** the physical qubits per logical qubit while maintaining nearest-neighbor square grid connectivity, narrowing the advantage the cat-qubit approach claims.

**Microsoft's Majorana 1** (February 2025) introduced an 8-qubit topological processor using InAs/Al topoconductors, with a _Nature_ 638, 651 (2025) paper on interferometric parity measurement. However, significant scientific skepticism remains — _Nature_ editors noted the results "do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes," and no gate operations or coherence measurements have been published. The manuscript could note this as an aspirational but experimentally immature competitor.

## Significant gaps in the related work discussion

**The operational bias gap deserves more attention.** The manuscript cites Qing et al.'s ~250 operational bias but does not adequately discuss its implications. The Putterman et al. companion paper (_Physical Review X_ 15, 011070, 2025; arXiv:2409.17556) — which demonstrated simultaneous phase coherence and exponential bit-flip suppression on a single AWS cat qubit — reveals that prior experiments achieved either high phase coherence or exponential noise bias, but not both simultaneously. The effective T₁ ≈ 70 μs represents a practical ceiling set by oscillator coherence, and buffer-induced nonlinearities (storage self-Kerr and cross-Kerr) are the most crucial parasitic parameters limiting phase coherence. The 200× gap between idle bias (>50,000) and operational bias (~250) during gates suggests that the error correction overhead may be substantially higher than calculations based on idle bias would predict.

**Alternative classical control paradigms are underrepresented.** The manuscript focuses on cryo-CMOS but omits competing approaches that may prove superior. A comprehensive review in _APL Quantum_ 2(4), 041501 (2024) compares four paradigms: room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS at 4 K, SFQ logic at millikelvin temperatures, and electro-optical/photonic links. SFQ logic is the only technology capable of operating at the millikelvin stage and can potentially scale to over 42,000 qubits in SIMD designs (DigiQ, arXiv:2202.01407). Shen et al. (_Nature Photonics_ 18, 371–378, 2024) demonstrated the first photonic link from SFQ circuits to room temperature. Arnold et al. (_Nature Physics_, 2025) achieved all-optical superconducting qubit readout at millikelvin temperatures requiring no active or passive cryogenic microwave equipment. A wireless terahertz cryogenic interconnect (_Nature Electronics_, 2025) demonstrates yet another approach. The manuscript's exclusive focus on cryo-CMOS may be overly narrow.

**Materials-driven coherence improvements change the calculus.** Bland et al. (_Nature_ 647, 343–348, 2025) demonstrated **T₁ up to 1.68 ms** in 2D tantalum-on-silicon transmon qubits — three times longer than previous records — with time-averaged quality factors of 9.7 × 10⁶ across 45 qubits. If storage resonators used for cat qubits achieve similar materials improvements, phase-flip rates would be dramatically reduced, altering the resource estimates. Bal et al. (_npj Quantum Information_ 10, 43, 2024) showed that niobium surface encapsulation with tantalum or gold yields median T₁ > 0.3 ms. The manuscript should discuss whether its assumed physical parameters account for such advances.

**Several theoretical advances in fault-tolerant overhead are missing.** Tamiya et al. (_Nature Physics_, 2025) achieved fault-tolerant quantum computation with both **polylogarithmic time** and **constant space** overheads simultaneously, combining qLDPC codes with concatenated Steane codes — setting new theoretical benchmarks. The circuit-level fault tolerance analysis of cat codes (_Quantum_, July 2025) moves beyond idealized noise models to realistic circuit-level analysis with faulty ancillas, providing more conservative threshold estimates. Leroux & Iverson (arXiv:2506.00130, June 2025) proposed Romanesco codes — bias-tailored qLDPC codes built from fractal codes that generalize the cellular automaton codes of Ruiz et al. — as a potentially superior outer code choice.

**The Ruiz et al. paper's assumptions need scrutiny.** The manuscript's claim of ~750–1000 physical cat qubits for 100 logical qubits closely tracks the 758-qubit figure from Ruiz et al. (_Nature Communications_ 16, 1040, 2025). However, this result assumes κ₁/κ₂ = 10⁻⁴, while the best experimentally demonstrated value is **κ₁/κ₂ = 6.5 × 10⁻³** — roughly 65× worse. Similarly, the target logical error rate of 10⁻⁸ requires a physical bit-flip time of ~13 minutes, which has only been demonstrated on single isolated qubits (the Galvanic Cat result), not in multi-qubit systems under gate operations. The manuscript should clearly delineate which assumptions have experimental backing and which remain aspirational.

## Bosonic code review literature the manuscript should reference

The most comprehensive bosonic code review from 2024 is Walshe et al., "Advances in Bosonic Quantum Error Correction with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Codes" (_Progress in Quantum Electronics_ 96, 100518, 2024; arXiv:2308.02913), which systematically compares cat, GKP, and binomial codes and includes a "no-threshold theorem" for general oscillator-to-oscillator codes. Guo et al. (_Communications Physics_ 8, 2025; arXiv:2410.17069) provide a universal framework for implementing bosonic codes in superconducting circuits using quantum lattice gates. The Bosonic Pauli+ simulation framework (_Quantum_, November 2024) enables efficient simulation of large-scale concatenated GKP codes. These references would strengthen the manuscript's positioning within the broader bosonic code landscape.

## Conclusion

The manuscript's bibliographic foundation is largely sound, with 8 of 10 citation clusters verifying exactly. The two factual errors — the **30–40× overstatement of Ocelot phase-flip time** and the **misattribution of the one-hour bit-flip result to Boson 4** — require immediate correction as they affect the manuscript's quantitative arguments. The Huang et al. author attribution should also be fixed. More substantially, the competitive landscape analysis needs expansion to address GKP-concatenation architectures, neutral-atom qLDPC implementations achieving 96 logical qubits, Quantinuum's trapped-ion qLDPC demonstrations, and Google's yoked surface codes. The gap between idle and operational noise bias (200× according to Qing et al.) deserves explicit discussion, as it suggests the error correction overhead may be higher than the manuscript implies. Finally, the manuscript should clearly flag which of its hardware assumptions (particularly κ₁/κ₂ = 10⁻⁴ and multi-qubit bit-flip times of ~13 minutes) have experimental support versus remaining as targets, and should discuss alternative control paradigms beyond cryo-CMOS.
